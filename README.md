# heatsrhink

This is a modified version of https://github.com/snakehand/heatshrink
The main difference is you decompress/read the decompressed data byte per byte.
It is useful for use cases such as font compression etc.. where the output can be big

Minimal no_std implementation of Heatshrink compression &amp; decompression
